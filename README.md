# DocumentCloud Klaxon Add-On

This repository contains a DocumentCloud Add-On that replicates the behavior of [Klaxon](https://github.com/themarshallproject/klaxon), which allows you to monitor web pages for changes on sections of the site that might be newsworthy. It allows you to receive email alerts when a modification to the page has been made, and a snapshot of the page is made on the Internet Archive automatically. 

To get started with Klaxon, you copy the bookmarklet [Add to Klaxon]((javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://documentcloud-klaxon.s3.amazonaws.com/inject.js';})();)
to your bookmarks, visit a page you want to monitor, and click on the bookmarklet.
