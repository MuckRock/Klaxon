# DocumentCloud Klaxon Add-On

This repository contains a DocumentCloud Add-On that replicates the behavior of [Klaxon](https://github.com/themarshallproject/klaxon), which allows you to monitor web pages for changes on sections of the site that might be newsworthy. It allows you to receive email or Slack alerts when a modification to the page has been made, and a snapshot of the page is made on the Internet Archive automatically.
